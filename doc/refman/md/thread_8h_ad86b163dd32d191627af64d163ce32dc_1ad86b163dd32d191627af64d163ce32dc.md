# oe_cond_wait()

Waits on a condition variable.

## Syntax

    oe_result_t oe_cond_wait(oe_cond_t *cond, oe_mutex_t *mutex)
## Description 

A thread calls this function to wait on a condition variable. If the condition variable is available, [oe_cond_wait()](thread_8h_ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc_1ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc.md) returns immediately. Otherwise, the thread is placed on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue where it waits to be signaled. The **mutex** parameter is used to synchronize access to the condition variable. The caller locks this mutex before calling [oe_cond_wait()](thread_8h_ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc_1ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc.md), which places the thread on the waiting queue and unlocks the mutex. When the thread is signaled by [oe_cond_signal()](thread_8h_a26f8a20cdc329cb8241ac7d0ce215663_1a26f8a20cdc329cb8241ac7d0ce215663.md), the waiting thread acquires the mutex and returns.

In enclaves, this function performs an OCALL, where the thread waits to be signaled.



## Parameters

#### cond

Wait on this condition variable.

#### mutex

This mutex must be locked by the caller.

## Returns

OE_OK the operation was successful

## Returns

OE_INVALID_PARAMETER one or more parameters is invalid

## Returns

OE_BUSY the mutex is not locked by the calling thread.
