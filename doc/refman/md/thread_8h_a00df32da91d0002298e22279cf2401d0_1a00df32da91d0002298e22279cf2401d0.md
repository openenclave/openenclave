## Syntax

    oe_result_t oe_cond_broadcast(oe_cond_t *cond)
## Description 

A thread calls this function to signal all threads waiting on the given condition variable. Waiting threads call [oe_cond_wait()](thread_8h_ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc_1ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc.md), which places them on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue, where they wait to be signaled. [oe_cond_broadcast()](thread_8h_a00df32da91d0002298e22279cf2401d0_1a00df32da91d0002298e22279cf2401d0.md) wakes up all threads on the queue, causing them to return from [oe_cond_wait()](thread_8h_ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc_1ad86b163dd32d191627af64d163ce32dc.md).
