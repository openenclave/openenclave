pythonExtension
====

This directory contains the sources for the GDB python extension. That
extension is used to load enclave symbol, enable enclave debugging, and
stitch stacks etc.

It will be loaded into gdb as a plugin. Please refer to
https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Extending-GDB.html for GDB
python extension model.
