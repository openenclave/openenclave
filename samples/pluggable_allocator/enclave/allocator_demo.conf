# snmalloc requires at least 256 KB per enclave thread.
# Given 16 enclave threads (NumTCS), this implies
#    minimum heap size = (256 * 1024 * 8) / 4096 = 512 pages.
# The heap size (4096 pages) is well above the minimum requirement,
# and accounts for the large number of allocations performed by
# each enclave thread in the sample.
