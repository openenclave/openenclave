# Configure OE SDK SGX on Linux in non-ACC Machines

## Disclaimer
This document is to provide a viable solution to enable Open Enclave SGX DCAP remote attestation to run on non-Azure Confidential Computing (ACC) machines. It relies on several Intel components and services which are subject to Intel's changes.

## 1. Platform requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS 64-bit.
- SGX1 capable system with Flexible Launch Control support. This feature is only available on Intel Coffee Lake processor (8th gen) or newer.
- It is strongly recommended to update your BIOS to newest version before start. With the setup described by this document, all attestation will be against the most recent collateral. Old BIOS versions, which may have lower CPU SVN, will cause attestation to fail.

## 2. Set up openenclave environment
### 2.1 Clone Open Enclave SDK repo from GitHub
Use the following command to download the source code.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave.git
```

This creates a source tree under the directory called openenclave.

### 2.2 Install project requirements

First, change directory into the openenclave repository:
```bash
cd openenclave
```

Ansible is required to install the project requirements. If not already installed, you can install it by running:
```bash
sudo scripts/ansible/install-ansible.sh
```

Then run the following command to install the dependency:
```bash
ansible-playbook scripts/ansible/oe-contributors-setup.yml
```
NOTE: The Ansible playbook commands from above will try to execute tasks with sudo privileges. Make sure that the user running the playbooks has sudo privileges, and if it uses a sudo password add the following extra parameter `--ask-become-pass`.

## 3. Set up Intel DCAP Quote Provider Library (QPL):
### 3.1 Install Intel DCAP Quote Provider Library
To install Intel DCAP Quote Provider Library, you can choose to install it from the Intel SGX repository (recommended), or install it manually with `dpkg`.

#### Option 1: Install Intel DCAP Quote Provider Library from the Intel SGX APT repository

If you set up your environment using this documentation, then the Intel SGX APT source repository has been added. Directly run the following command to install the package.

```bash
sudo apt install libsgx-dcap-default-qpl
```

NOTE: In case the Intel SGX APT source repository is not added to your system. Run the following commands to add it.

On Ubuntu:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu $(lsb_release --codename --short) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list
```

Add the key to the list of trusted keys used by the apt to authenticate packages:
```bash
wget -qO - https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

Update apt package database
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Option 2: Install Intel DCAP Quote Provider with dpkg manually

Intel DCAP Quote Provider package can be installed manually by finding the appropriate libsgx-dcap-default-qpl package in [the Intel SGX DCAP repository](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/). As there are multiple different versions available, please download the version that matches Intel SGX version and your OS version. 

##### Ubuntu 20.04 instructions
For Ubuntu 20.04 (code name [Focal Fossa](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa)), please download the sgx_debian_local_repo for the latest supported version of Intel DCAP. Afterwards, extract the tgz and install `sgx_debian_local_repo/pool/main/libs/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl_{VERSION}-focal1_amd64.deb`.

In this document, we use Ubuntu 20.04 and Intel DCAP 1.16 as an example, so we will use [sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.16/linux/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz)

1. Download the package.
```bash
cd ~
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.16/linux/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz
```
2. Extract the package.
```bash
tar xvzf sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz
```

3. Install the package.
```bash
sudo dpkg -i sgx_debian_local_repo/pool/main/libs/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl_1.16.100.2-focal1_amd64.deb
```

##### Ubuntu 22.04 instructions
For Ubuntu 22.04, please download the sgx_debian_local_repo for the latest supported version of Intel DCAP. Afterwards, extract the tgz and install `sgx_debian_local_repo/pool/main/libs/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl_{VERSION}-jammy1_amd64.deb`.

Below we use Intel DCAP 1.22 as an example.

1. Download the package.
```bash
cd ~
wget hhttps://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.22/linux/distro/ubuntu22.04-server/sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz
```
2. Extract the package.
```bash
tar xvzf sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz
```

3. Install the package.
```bash
sudo dpkg -i sgx_debian_local_repo/pool/main/libs/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl/libsgx-dcap-default-qpl-dev_1.22.100.3-jammy1_amd64
```

### 3.2 Create a soft link
OE expects the file name of the QPL to be libdcap_quoteprov.so. But libsgx-dcap-default-qpl only creates files such as libdcap_quoteprov.so.1 and libdcap_quoteprov.so.1.13.103.2 of which libdcap_quoteprov.so.1 is a soft link to libdcap_quoteprov.so.1.13.103.2. To allow OE to work properly, we need to create the other soft link called libdcap_quoteprov.so to link to libdcap_quoteprov.so.1.13.103.2

Check where those files are installed.
```bash
dpkg --listfiles libsgx-dcap-default-qpl
```

In most cases, it should be in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/` so we use that path as an example.
```bash
cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
sudo ln -s libdcap_quoteprov.so.1.13.103.2 libdcap_quoteprov.so
```

NOTES TO USERS WHO HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED AZURE DCAP CLIENT:

If you have [Azure DCAP Client](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-DCAP-Client) installed before trying these instructions, please make sure the Azure one is renamed to something else.

To check if you have it installed, run the following command.
```bash
dpkg --list | grep az-dcap-client
```

If you don't have the Azure DCAP Client installed previously, please skip the content below.

In most cases the Azure version of libdcap_quoteprov.so is located in /usr/lib. Check your path before changing. Here we use `/usr/lib` as an example.

```bash
sudo mv /usr/lib/libdcap_quoteprov.so /usr/lib/libdcap_quoteprov.so.azure
```

Otherwise the Azure one might still get used because `$PATH` might have `/usr/lib` before the path `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` with the Intel version.

### 3.3 Configure the QPL
Edit the file `/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf`. To accept insecure HTTPS cert, set the option `use_secure_cert` to `false` as we will use a local caching service which doesn't have a secure cert.

```bash
 // To accept insecure HTTPS certificate, set this option to false
 ,"use_secure_cert": false
```

Note:
The cert mentioned in `/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf` is just for a regular TLS handshaking between the QPL and the PCCS. That cert itself has nothing to do with attestation process. It has no relationship with the certs (e.g., Provisioning Certification Key certs (PCK certs)) that are being used in the attestation.

Setting `"use_secure_cert": false` doesn't mean your attestation process is insecure. It just means QPL will accept a self-signed cert for the TLS handshake with PCCS. A CA-signed/self-signed cert might be a better word than a "secure/insecure" cert. But that's exactly how the `/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf` describes it so we document it accordingly.

## 4 Set up local Provisioning Certificate Caching Service (PCCS)
### 4.1 Register an Intel developer account and get a subscription key

If you don't have an Intel account, go to [https://www.intel.com](https://www.intel.com) to register one by using the button at the corner.

![Intel Account](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/images/intel-account.png)

Sign in with your Intel account and then go to
[https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification)

You should see a screen similar to the following:

![Subscribe1](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/images/subscribe1.png)

Next, click the subscribe button. You should see a screen similar to the following:

![Subscribe2](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/images/subscribe2.png)

Click the subscribe button again. You should be presented with your subscription information.

![Primary Key](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/images/primary-key.png)

Save the value of your primary key, which will be used during PCCS service bring up.

### 4.2 Install and Config PCCS

Install nodejs and npm if you haven't already.

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

To install PCCS, you can choose to install it from the Intel SGX repository (recommended), or install it manually with `dpkg`.

#### Option 1: Install PCCS from the Intel SGX repository
```bash
sudo apt install sgx-dcap-pccs
```
NOTE: In case the Intel SGX APT source repository is not added to your system, refer to [Section 3.1 for steps to add it](#option-1-install-intel-dcap-quote-provider-library-from-the-intel-sgx-apt-repository)

#### Option 2: Install PCCS with dpkg manually

PCCS can be installed manually by following Appendix 2 of the [Intel SGX SW Installation Guide for Linux](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.22/linux/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf) and obtaining the appropriate package in [the Intel SGX DCAP repository](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/pool/main/web/sgx-dcap-pccs/). As there are multiple different versions available, please download the version that matches your Intel SGX DCAP version and your OS version.

You will be asked to finish the configuration during the installation process.

![Config](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/images/config.png)

Recommended config:
- `HTTPS listening port:` 
    - Use default value.
- `Set the PCCS service to accept local connections only:`
    - Use default value.
- `Set your Intel Provisioning Certificate Service(PCS) API key:`
    - Use the primary key of your subscription.
- `Choose caching fill method:`
    - Use default value.
- `Set PCCS server administrator password:`
    - Set your password.
- `Set PCCS server user password:`
    - Set your password.
- `Do you want to generate insecure HTTPS key and cert for PCCS service?:`
    - Use default value, then type in your info at the following prompts.
- You can skip the following two items.
    - `A challenge password []:`
    - `An optional company name []:`
  
Then check the status of your service.
```bash
pm2 status
```

NOTE: If the `pm2` command is not found, you may need to install `pm2` globally by running the following command.
```bash
sudo npm i -g pm2
```

You should be able to see the service is running.
![nodejs](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/images/nodejs.png)

Run the following command to verify if it can actually fetch the root CA CRL from the Intel PCK service.
```bash
curl --noproxy "*" -v -k -G "https://localhost:8081/sgx/certification/v4/rootcacrl"
```

To learn more about PCCS, please refer to the [PCCS GitHub repository](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/QuoteGeneration/pccs).

## 5. Build and verify if the OE remote attestation works

### 5.1 Build
To build, first create a build directory ("build" in the example below) and change directory into it.

```bash
cd ~/openenclave/
mkdir build
cd build
```

Then run `cmake` to configure the build and generate the Makefiles, and then build by running `make` or `ninja` accordingly

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```
or
```bash
cmake -G "Ninja" ..
ninja
```

After building, run all unit test cases using `ctest` to confirm the SDK is built and working as expected.

Run the following command from the build directory:

```bash
ctest
```

You will see test logs similar to the following:

```bash
~/openenclave/build$  ctest

Test project /home/youradminusername/openenclave/build
      Start   1: tests/aesm
1/123 Test   #1: tests/aesm ...............................................................................................................   Passed    0.98 sec
      Start   2: tests/mem
2/123 Test   #2: tests/mem ................................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec
      Start   3: tests/str
3/123 Test   #3: tests/str ................................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec
....
....
....
122/123 Test #122: tools/oedump .............................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec
            Start 123: oeelf
123/123 Test #123: oeelf ....................................................................................................................   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 123

Total Test time (real) =  83.61 sec
```

A clean pass of the above unit tests is an indication that your Open Enclave setup was successful.

The remote attestation tests/samples above will only succeed when using a production CPU. 
If you want remote attestation tests/samples to succeed on a pre-production CPU, refer to the following steps to switch the back-end provisioning server to pre-production.

## 6. (Optional) Verify OE remote attestation on pre-production platforms
You will need to make some changes in Step 4.1 and 5 above when using the pre-production platforms.

### 6.1 Get SBX (Sand Box) primary key for Provisioning Certificate Caching Service (PCCS) in Step 4.1
Get the SBX primary key from [https://sbx.api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification](https://sbx.api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification).
The steps for installing and configuring PCCS are similar to [Step 4.2](#42-install-and-config-pccs).

Please check PCCS configuration file (`config/production-0.json`)
- uri - The URL needs to be set as `https://sbx.api.trustedservices.intel.com/sgx/certification/v2/`.
- ApiKey - The API key needs to be set as SBX primary key.

### 6.2 Replace the Intel root certificate's public key value before Step 5

```patch
common/sgx/quote.c
 // Public key of Intel's root certificate.
 static const char* g_expected_root_certificate_key =
     "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
-    "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEC6nEwMDIYZOj/iPWsCzaEKi71OiO\n"
-    "SLRFhWGjbnBVJfVnkY4u3IjkDYYL0MxO4mqsyYjlBalTVYxFP2sJBK5zlA==\n"
+    "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAET/oP/VYc2tbA+Y0wjIEoxbknonMy\n"
+    "yOjrE/a+QrVx1kZvU8ZE/8L/wQKCIOSaSWbPAvMuL7TTSbssuu0okDegLQ==\n"
     "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n";

common/sgx/tcbinfo.c
 // Public key of Intel's root certificate.
 static const char* _trusted_root_key_pem =
     "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
-    "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEC6nEwMDIYZOj/iPWsCzaEKi71OiO\n"
-    "SLRFhWGjbnBVJfVnkY4u3IjkDYYL0MxO4mqsyYjlBalTVYxFP2sJBK5zlA==\n"
+    "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAET/oP/VYc2tbA+Y0wjIEoxbknonMy\n"
+    "yOjrE/a+QrVx1kZvU8ZE/8L/wQKCIOSaSWbPAvMuL7TTSbssuu0okDegLQ==\n"
     "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n";
```
